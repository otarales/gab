                <h2>How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?</h2>
                <h3 id="t1">What Is Bitcoin Mining?</h3>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation; it is also the way that new transactions are confirmed by the network and a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger. "Mining" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem is awarded the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again.

                    Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners are rewarded for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it?

                <p>
                    However, before you invest the time and equipment, read this explainer to see whether mining is really for you. We will focus primarily on Bitcoin (throughout, we'll use "Bitcoin" when referring to the network or the cryptocurrency as a concept, and "bitcoin" when we're referring to a quantity of individual tokens).
                </p>
                <h3 id="t2">A New Gold Rush</h3>
                <p>
                    The primary draw for many mining is the prospect of being rewarded with Bitcoin. That said, you certainly don't have to be a miner to own cryptocurrency tokens. You can also buy cryptocurrencies using FIAT currency; you can buy this coin from bitcoin.com amongst other vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining: to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because these responsibilities are spread among many users all over the world, Bitcoin is a "decentralized" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.
                </p>
                <h3 id="t3">Mining and Bitcoin Circulation</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to lining the pockets of miners and supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem, mining serves another vital purpose: It is the only way to release new cryptocurrency into circulation. In other words, miners are basically "minting" currency. For example, as of September 2021, there were around 18.82 million bitcoins in circulation, out of an ultimate total of 21 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from the coins minted via the genesis block (the very first block, which was created by founder Satoshi Nakamoto), every single one of those bitcoins came into being because of miners. In the absence of miners, Bitcoin as a network would still exist and be usable, but there would never be any additional bitcoin. However, because the rate of bitcoin "mined" is reduced over time, the final bitcoin won't be circulated until around the year 2140. This does not mean that transactions will cease to be verified. Miners will continue to verify transactions and will be paid in fees for doing so in order to keep the integrity of Bitcoin's network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from the short-term Bitcoin payoff, being a coin miner can give you "voting" power when changes are proposed in the Bitcoin network protocol. This is known as a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Protocol). In other words, miners have some degree of influence on the decision-making process on such matters as forking (In blockchain technology, a soft fork is a change to the software protocol where only previously valid transaction blocks are made invalid).
                </p>
                <h3 id="t4">How Much a Miner Earns</h3>
                <p>
                    The rewards for Bitcoin mining are reduced by half roughly every four years.1 When bitcoin was first mined in 2009, mining one block would earn you 50 BTC. In 2012, this was halved to 25 BTC. By 2016, this was halved again to 12.5 BTC. On May 11, 2020, the reward halved again to 6.25 BTC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September of 2021, the price of Bitcoin was about $45,000 per bitcoin, which means you'd have earned $281,250 (6.25 x 45,000) for completing a block. Not a bad incentive to solve that complex hash problem detailed above, it might seem.
                </p>
                <h3 id="t5">What You Need to Mine Bitcoins</h3>
                <p>
                    Although early on in Bitcoin's history individuals may have been able to compete for blocks with a regular at-home personal computer, this is no longer the case. The reason for this is that the difficulty of mining Bitcoin changes over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the blockchain and its ability to process and verify transactions, the Bitcoin network aims to have one block produced every 10 minutes or so. However, if there are one million mining rigs competing to solve the hash problem, they'll likely reach a solution faster than a scenario in which 10 mining rigs are working on the same problem. For that reason, Bitcoin is designed to evaluate and adjust the difficulty of mining every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When there is more computing power collectively working to mine for bitcoins, the difficulty level of mining increases in order to keep block production at a stable rate. Less computing power means the difficulty level decreases. At today's network size, a personal computer mining for bitcoin will almost certainly find nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this is to say that, in order to mine competitively, miners must now invest in powerful computer equipment like a GPU (graphics processing unit) or, more realistically, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). These can run from $500 to the tens of thousands. Some miners—particularly Bitcoin miners—buy individual graphics cards (GPUs) as a low-cost way to cobble together mining operations.
                </p>
                <h3 id="t6">Downsides of Mining </h3>
                <p>
                    Individually, if you make investment in our ASIC miner the only downside you may face is that at the end of the mining program, because the completed blocks are shared amongst other investors, your profit may be a few hundred dollars down compared with the actual net profit. Chances of this happening is 1% out of 100% so you should be all good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our company, one potential risk from the growth of Bitcoin mining (and other proof-of-work systems as well) is the increasing energy usage required by the computer systems running the mining algorithms. While microchip efficiency has increased dramatically for ASIC chips, the growth of the network itself is outpacing technological progress. As a result, there are concerns about the environmental impact and carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining.

                                Mining is used as a metaphor for introducing new bitcoins into the system, since it requires (computational) work just as mining for gold or silver requires (physical) effort. Of course, the tokens that miners find are virtual and exist only within the digital ledger of the Bitcoin blockchain.

                                Since they are entirely digital records, there is a risk of copying, counterfeiting, or double-spending the same coin more than once. Mining solves these problems by making it extremely expensive and resource-intensive to try to do one of these things or otherwise "hack" the network. Indeed, it is far more cost-effective to join the network as a miner than to try to undermine it.

                                In addition to introducing new BTC into circulation, mining serves the crucial role of confirming and validating new transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is important because there is no central authority such as a bank, court, government, or anything else determining which transactions are valid and which are not. Instead, the mining process achieves a decentralized consensus through proof-of-work (PoW).

                                In the early days of Bitcoin, anybody could simply run a mining program from their PC or laptop. But, as the network got larger and more people became interested in mining, the difficulty of the mining algorithm became more difficult. This is because the code for Bitcoin targets finding a new block once every ten minutes, on average. If more miners are involved, the chances that somebody will solve the right hash quicker increases, and so the difficulty is raised to restore that 10-minute goal. Now imagine if thousands, or even millions more times of mining power joins the network. That's a lot of new machines consuming energy.
